Welcome to my blog! I am an undergraduate at UCLA studying computational biology. I am the research coordinator of CruX UCLA where I lead the development of Brain Computer Interface software and contribute to research publications on EEG/EMG transfer learning. My experience extends to game development, where I have won two university-wide game jams and serve as the Game Jam Officer for ACM Studio at UCLA. Additionally, I have internship experience in AI content development and machine learning model engineering.
