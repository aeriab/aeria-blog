### Your short-term memory is a free cheat sheet !!

Between back-to-back finals, I've discovered some mental prep tricks, especially crucial when notes aren't allowed. The biggest challenge? Preventing concept confusion across subjects. Take "K," for instance: equilibrium and Boltzmann constants in chemistry, kinetic energy in physics, and carrying capacity in life science. Then there's lowercase "k," which means rate constant and Coulomb's constant in chemistry, spring force constant in physics, and the "kilo-" prefix. That's just one example of how easily concepts can blur.

To combat this, I've developed a short-term memory cheat sheet method. An hour before an exam, I jot down my seven most confusing concepts with textbook or online help. Then, I try to recreate it from memory. The inevitable initial failures are the point. After a few attempts, I can replicate it perfectly. This "cheat sheet" stays fresh in my mind, priming my short-term memory. If time allows, I even recreate parts of it at the exam's start, ensuring I have that info readily available, even hours in.

Here's a potentially unpopular strategy: I completely forget the previous exam's content. Post-exam discussions are common, but with another, unrelated exam looming, it's vital to shift focus immediately.

Forcing myself to forget is tough, but my brain needs to reorient, particularly with so much conceptual overlap.

It sucks to be actively trying to forget about a test I just took, but the reality is that my brain needs to be reoriented for the next test, especially when there are so many overlapping concepts.
