### Your short-term memory is a free cheat sheet !!

I am currently between final exams, and I have realized that there are some tricks to being as mentally prepared as possible before an exam. My final exams are back to back, and there are no physical notes allowed. This can make it extremely difficult to get into the right mindset and not confuse concepts across the different study subjects. For example, the letter "K" is used as the equilibrium constant and Boltzmann constant in chemistry, "K" is kinetic energy for my physics exam, and "K" also represents carrying capacity in my life science class. Not to be confused with lowercase "k" which represents the rate constant and Coulomb constant in chemistry, the spring force constant in physics, and also the "kilo-" prefix for units of measurement. And that's just one small example of a concept that could easily be muddled across subjects.

It is important to recognize and squash these confusions before going into a test, so I offer my short-term memory cheat sheet method: within one hour before taking an exam, take a pencil and paper, write out the seven most confusing concepts/definitions using the help of a textbook or reputable internet source, then attempt to recreate this cheat sheet from memory. I might struggle and fail to recreate the whole cheat sheet from memory, but this is exactly what I want. After about three attempts, I can replicate my cheat sheet from memory. With this cheat sheet in mind (literally), I have done my best to prep my short-term memory for the tribulations ahead. If I know I'll have ample time to complete the exam, I will even replicate some of the cheat sheet from memory once the exam starts. This ensures I have access to that information, even 3 hours into a brutal exam.

This might be a hot take, but another tactic I have adopted is completely forgetting about the content of an exam I just completed. After every exam, I see so many people asking "How did you solve this problem?", but if I have another completely unrelated exam coming up the next day, in my experience, it is important to forget about my last test as quickly as possible.

It sucks to be actively trying to forget about a test I just took, but the reality is that my brain needs to be reoriented for the next test, especially when there are so many overlapping concepts.
