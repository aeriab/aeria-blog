### Your short-term memory is a free cheat sheet !!

I am currently between Finals exams, and I have realized that there are some tricks to being as mentally prepared as possible before going into an exam. My finals exams are back to back, and there are no physical notes allowed. This can make it extremely difficult to get into the right mindset and not confuse concepts across the different subjects of study. For example, the letter "K" is used as the equilibrium constant in chemistry, it was kinetic energy for my physics exam, and it also represents carrying capacity in my life science class. Not to be confused with lower case "k" which represents the rate constant in chemistry, the spring force constant in physics, and also the "kilo-" prefix for units of measurement.

It is important to recognize and squash these confusions before going into a test, and so I offer my short-term memory cheat sheet method: within one hour before taking an exam, take a pencil and paper, write out the seven most confusing concepts/definitions using the help of a textbook or reputable internet source, then attempt to recreate this cheat sheet from memory. I might struggle and fail to recreate the whole cheat sheet from memory, but this is exactly what I want. After about three attempts, I am ussually able to somewhat replicate my cheat sheet from memory. With this cheat sheet in mind (literally), I have done my best to prep my short term memory for the test. If I know I'll have ample time to complete the exam, I will even replicate some of the cheat sheet from memory once the exam starts, just to make sure I have access to that information later on in the test.

Another tactic that I have adopted is completely forgetting about the content of an exam I just completed. After every exam I see so many people asking "how did you solve for _____" or "is it true that ____", but if I have another completely unrelated exam coming up the next day, in my experience, it is important to forget about my last test as quickly as possible.

It sucks to be actively trying to forget about a test I just took, but the reality is that my brain needs to be reoriented for the next test where there are so many overlapping concepts.
