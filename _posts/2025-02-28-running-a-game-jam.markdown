# This is how I hosted the Cozy Game Jam for UCLA üòä

Game jams are the quintessential game development competition. In a game jam, developers commit to making a game based on a central theme and submit it within a set time constraint. The theme is announced at the official start time of the jam. This theme announcement serves two main purposes: to provide a starting point for participants and to help enforce the rule that games must be made from scratch. If a theme is specific enough, it excludes pre-existing projects, ensuring all submissions are original.

For the Cozy Jam, teams had 72 hours to make a game using the theme ‚Äú**Chill.**‚Äù Since this jam took place in the midst of UCLA‚Äôs midterm season, I emphasized its low-stakes nature. There were no restrictions on art style, game engine, or even the type of game‚Äîsome participants made board games or even physical games. I intentionally kept the theme open-ended to encourage creativity and unique submissions. Since there was no prize, I didn‚Äôt have to worry about enforcing strict originality rules‚Äîthe entire point was to be *cozy*, after all.

## Creativity vs. Rule Enforcement üé®üöì

When running a game jam, there‚Äôs often a tradeoff between encouraging creativity and preventing rule violations. I tend to prioritize creativity, but high-stakes jams like Ludum Dare need to ensure strict adherence to the *made-from-scratch* rule without stifling developers. One interesting way Ludum Dare manages this is by having two categories:

- **Jam (72 hours):** No team size limit, pre-made assets allowed, looser rules.

- **Compo (48 hours):** Solo-only, strict rules requiring open-sourced code, no pre-made assets, and restrictions on using pre-existing gameplay code.

This allows for open-ended themes like *‚ÄúTiny Creatures‚Äù* (Ludum Dare 56) while maintaining fairness. The strict rules make Compo submissions all the more impressive.

## Advice for Newcomers ‚ô•Ô∏è

Complete beginners are almost always part of the target audience for game jams because anyone with a computer can join and contribute to the game dev community. My number one tip for new developers: **fall in love with the process, not just the product.**

Don‚Äôt get fixated on making the game of your dreams‚Äîappreciate the beauty of **procedural generation, well-tuned physics, or emergent gameplay** just to name a few. These aspects of game development both make the game development process more fun and, when executed with care, make playing the game more fun. That is the ultimate goal‚Äîto enjoy the process of making a fun game. If you focus on churning out the exact video game of your dreams before you have worked with and appreciated these essential aspects of game development, you will inevitably fail to have fun, and you will get burnt out before you make a fun game. I still want you to go and make the game of your dreams, I just caution newcomers from biting off more than they can chew. Once you have some exploratory projects under your belt, perhaps you are ready to turn your dreams into reality.

## My Journey into Game Development ‚öíÔ∏è

Playing games like *Chess* and *Minecraft* has always been a big part of my life, and I fell in love with game development during the COVID era (8th to 9th grade). I first discovered this rewarding hobby through the charismatic game development YouTuber [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA), which got me hooked on Unity for the next four years. During that time, I made games involving *ragdoll physics, machine learning agents, virtual reality, pathfinding algorithms*, and a whole lot more. Most importantly, it introduced me to software development fundamentals like **version control and debugging**. Now I am using those fundamental skills in my work on my personal website, as head researcher for CruX UCLA, as a computer vision engineer for Bruin AI, and even in creating this blog. üòá

Recently, however, I‚Äîalong with a large portion of Unity developers‚Äîhave jumped on the **Godot** bandwagon. If you‚Äôre new to game development, I highly encourage you to check out [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). It‚Äôs lightweight (only 50MB!), and I love how the built-in code editor seamlessly integrates with the game engine. The GameObject equivalent, called **Nodes**, can be dragged and dropped straight into the code editor. Plus, since Godot is open-source, it benefits from continuous community-driven improvements. *That‚Äôs the end of my Godot glazing.* üòç

## Acknowledgments & Future Jams ü§î

I couldn‚Äôt have run this game jam without the incredible support of the **ACM Studio Interns and Officers**. Huge thanks to our marketing and engagement team for creating this awesome promotional graphic:
