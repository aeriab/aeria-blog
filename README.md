Here are the key files and folders in a Jekyll project:

  _posts/: This is where you'll write your blog posts. They should be named in the format YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md (e.g., 2024-07-26-my-first-post.md).
  
  _drafts/: For posts you're still working on.
  
  _site/: This is where Jekyll generates your website files. You generally won't edit files here directly.
  
  index.html: Your homepage template.
  
  _config.yml: Your Jekyll configuration file. This is where you'll customize your blog's settings.
  
  Gemfile: Lists the Ruby gems (including Jekyll) your project depends on.

For developer:

bundle exec jekyll serve
